sac_1:0 "Sac City Reborn"
sac_1_desc:0 "Sac-Town was once the former capital of California before the bombs fell, and not long after that, it became a bastion for raiders and tribals, notably the 80's.

However, the 80's were little match for the republic military that later pushed them out from their homelands, and to this day, their numerous garages and temples lay mostly untouched, as do the secrets contained within them."

sac_3:0 "Baron Investment Opportunities"
sac_3_desc:0 "The economic power of the Baron's can't be understated, and while they often feud, when their minds are put to a task, they can accomplish almost anything within reason. Be it the forced takeover of criminal assets, the corruption of the local police force, or a simple aggressive acquisition of all local competitors."

sac_4:0 "The new Wall to the North"
sac_4_desc:0 "Relations with Redding in the north have never been good. With tensions guaranteed, the locals at the northern border have petitioned the republican government and the baron for safety.

rivalry_redding:0 "The never ending Story"
rivalry_redding_desc:0 "The Story of Redding is one of discontent among both sides. It began as the northern part of the Baron's Republic being discontent about the state of supplies and turned over time to a full blown rebellion of the ranchers there. After the ranchers declared independence, they were brutally massacred by the exact people they claimed to protect. The community of Redding was born after that act of betrayal and cruelty."

union:0 "The Baron's Republic"
union_desc:0 "As time passed by, the constant infight brew it's own problems. With well connected, respected and good equipped families fighting each other, no real progress could be made. An ambitious rancher attempted to change that. His name was Anton Flynn."

############################## Republican Military #####################################

republican_military:0 "The Republican Military"
republican_military_desc:0 "After the Republic has been founded, Flynn knows that his daring act of unification is a lost cause without the capability to defend his very idea of a republic.

jims_army:0 "Jims Army"

jims_draft:0 "Jim's Draft"
jims_draft_desc:0 "The ongoing drills and marches have made tough, respectable men that can be trusted to work as a real force. Big Jim realizes that he needs to put more effort to get new recruits to join the ranks of the fresh republican army. After all, strength still lies in good training as well as numbers."
jims_concept:0 "Jims Concept"
jims_concept_desc:0 "Everything the newly founded army has done will bear fruit. With the recruits gaining experience by the day it is only a matter of time until this army will be a force to be reckoned with. Big Jim does what he can to bring his very own concept to life."

magnums_ideas:0 "Magnum's Ideas"
magnums_ideas_desc:0 "Given the rather tensious relationship between Magnum Boyd and Anton Flynn, it surprised many ranchers that the baron decided to aid Magnum in his endeavour to follow the idea of a proper equipment for the fresh republican forces, for the best man can be worthless without his proper tools."
magnums_standardization_act:0 "Magnum's Standardization Act"
magnums_standardization_act_desc:0 " Although the political differences between the rather conservative Flynn and the progressive Magnum are obvious, Flynn sees merit in his ideas.

magnums_mech_core:0 "Magnum's Mech Core"
magnums_mech_core_desc:0 "With the political help of Flynn, Magnum holds his end of the bargain. He makes great efforts to install mechanic structures out of the former 80's remnants that support a future motorization of our forces."
magnums_shock_companies:0 "Magnum's Shock Companies"

polatlis_idea:0 "Polatli's Idea"
polatlis_idea_desc:0 "Joseph Polatli was one of the minor landowners that has roots in the area around sac-city since it was retaken from the 80's. He presented to Flynn his believe that in order for the republic to be defensable, it has to build an air force. The rather humble beginning of this endeavour is the renovation of the pre-war sac-city Airport."

################################## EVENTS ##############################################

brr_events.1:0 "Stockton Crime"
brr_events.1.t:0 "Stockton Crime"
brr_events.1.d:0 "Crime has been an issue in Stockton for the better part of seven generations. Always growing a little worse, getting a little closer to being utterly out of hand. Only the barons have the influence and the power to put a stop to it, but then again... who's to say they won't just cash in?"
brr_events.1.a:0 "The Barons invest in Drugs."
brr_events.1.b:0 "The Barons invest in Weapons."
brr_events.1.c:0 "The Barons crack down on crime."

brr_events.2.t:0 "The Red Feast"
brr_events.2.d:0 "As the other barons arrive at the festival house that has undergone serious preparations, Anton Flynn smiles down from his balcony. From here, he can watch as the crowd of his fellow oligarchic friends and enemies alike becomes larger. From here he can see the curtains that currently block the line of view. The guests think that behind them their next hedonistic pleasure is being prepared, like the host of the evening has promised. If they ony knew that Flynn's most loyal men wait there, ready to shoot on his command..."
brr_events.2.a:0 "Let the party begin!"

brr_events.3.t:0 "Baron's Council Hill Meeting"
brr_events.3.d:0 "The Barons have been summoned to converse about the future of the republic. The presence of the military leaders is supposed to be of little importance since the great landowners demand concessions in order to hold the peace inside the whole state. Flynn offers to take over the peace talks but he demands to be a part of the future government. Without his influence and help, we will not be able to convince the other landowners and ranchers which will seriously impact our stability. A choice has to be made."
brr_events.3.a:0 "No compromise! This will be a people's republic!"
brr_events.3.b:0 "We should make a deal with Flynn. Better some small scale democracy than civil war."

brr_events.4.t:0 "The Baron's Union"
brr_events.4.d:0 "One man grew tired of the sportslike feuding the other ranchers persued. Anton Flynn. He realized that only if the ranchers would unite, they would be able to uphold the living style of their ancestors. Determined to change things, he started to create the republic with him being the protecting baron."
brr_events.4.a:0 "Flynn set up a meeting with the other ranchers to persuade them"
brr_events.4.b:0 "Flynn rallied supporters among the ranchers and coerced the rest"
brr_events.4.c:0 "Flynn worked to gain the support of various ranchers without any further infight"

brr_events.5.t:0 "Beginnings of the Ranchers"
brr_events.5.d:0 "Before the baron's republic has been formed, the lands that are now a part of it were mostly independent communities that grew and fell with their leaders. In the agricultural lands of the now known republic, this position often fell to the ranchers that built their domains and protected them, feeling responsible for their people, their economic success and something good for the next generation to leave behind."
brr_events.5.a:0 "The ranchers depended heavily on their economic success"
brr_events.5.b:0 "The ranchers took special care of their people"
brr_events.5.c:0 "The ranchers worked hard to leave something good behind for the next generation"

brr_events.6.t:0 "Rancher's feuds"
brr_events.6.d:0 "The backside of independent domains such as the rancher's was a constant possibility of war and distrust, which often lead to feuds between the ranchers that brought problems with it. To win a feud, a rancher had multiple possibilities. He could rely on mercenaries, his economic power or his political standing to fight his rival."
brr_events.6.a:0 "Ranchers fought each other with mercenaries"

brr_events.8.t:0 "Dayglow Ranger Agreement"
brr_events.8.d:0 "A representative from the baron's republic has arrived. Our highly skilled ranger forces under the command of Ranger general Mossman command the respect of the republic. The Baron wishes to make Dayglow an offer: Various favorably trade deals and good relations with the Baron's Republic in exchange for our help in training their own Ranger forces. How do we react?"
brr_events.8.a:0 "We agree."
brr_events.8.b:0 "We decline."

brr_events.9.t:0 "Rise and Fall"
brr_events.9.d:0 "The once great city that is now simply known as "Sac-City" was a great metropolis of pre war times. Nostalgia as well as constantly present rumors get scavengers from all over the country to Sac-City to scavenge the ruins of the past. Sometimes, fate smiles upon them."
brr_events.9.a:0 "Power armor! Just kidding...."
brr_events.9.b:0 "Gatling Lasers! In my dreams..."
brr_events.9.c:0 "A cure for cancer! Not really..."

brr_events.10.t:0 "Baron's league, season one"
brr_events.10.d:0 "the first season is held in the freshly renovated Sleep Train Arena. With many teams signing up for the league, three teams are the outspoken favourites of the season. Firstly, the republican military sends a team from it's very first land division. Secondly, the newly founded Sacramento Kings that are backed by Anton Flynn and his supporters. Lastly, a team of former scavengers from Stockton has signed up to get their adrenaline kick. Who will win the first season of many to follow?"

brr_events.10.b:0 "The first land division, saviours of the republic"
brr_events.10.c:0 "The Sacramento Kings, the professionals of tomorrow"

brr_events.11.t:0 "An offer from the baron's republic"
brr_events.11.d:0 "As it appears, our newly founded sports league is getting some recognition from the outside. The Baron's Republic has formally asked to join it in order to send their own teams at the start of the next season. Agreeing to this could deepen our connection with the republic in the north while declining could be seen as a move of strong will towards the nationalists. How should we respond?"
brr_events.11.a:0 "We agree. Let the Republic join the league!"
brr_events.11.b:0 "We decline. No dirty ranchers in our league!"

brr_events.12.t:0 "a surprising offer from the Baron's Republic"
brr_events.12.d:0 "Today a representative from the Baron's Republic has arrived at Redding. His additude was surprisingly calm and polite, despite being immediately apprehended by our guards. He claims to just want to make an offer to us that comes directly from the Baron himself; The recognition of our sovereignty. Without anything demanded in return, the offer seems too good to be true. On the other hand, why not try to give peace a chance in the wasteland?"
brr_events.12.a:0 "Let's be daring. We accept the generous offer."
brr_events.12.b:0 "The shady Baron cannot be trusted!"

brr_events.13.t:0 "Calling for a truce"
brr_events.13.d:0 "Our relationship with the Baron's Republic has never been great. Since our secession, the barons resent us with every inch of their body, while we gladly returned this favor. Out of our secession grew several conflicts that in return made more reasons for both parties to continue a constant state of war against each other. Until now, that is. Our troops stopped reporting incidends along the border to the Baron's Republic and now we even received a formal calling for a truce from the Baron himself. First politicians are already in the process of celebrating the first victory of the independent state of Redding while several higher ups in the military remain suspicious."
brr_events.13.a:0 "Time for a leap of faith. We sign the truce."
brr_events.13.b:0 "Just another scheme of the Barons, no doubt!"

brr_events.14.t:0 "Guarantee accepted"
brr_events.14.d:0 "Our offer was accepted!"
brr_events.14.a:0 "Good."

brr_events.15.t:0 "A matter of independence"
brr_events.15.d:0 "A messenger from the Baron's Republic has arrived today in our capital. He brings word from the Baron himself who wants to deepen our relationship with a treaty that guarantees the independence of both parties. How do we react?"
brr_events.15.a:0 "We sign the treaty."
brr_events.15.b:0 "We refuse."

brr_events.16.t:0 "A non-aggression pact with the Baron's Republic?"
brr_events.16.d:0 "Today a messenger arrived from the Baron's Republic. He carries a message from the Baron in which he declares his intention of a friendly relation to us. To make this intention a reality, he asks us to sign a pact of non-aggression."
